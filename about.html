            Who I Am
          </h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              Hi, I'm <strong>Stephen Oisewemen</strong>, a passionate frontend
              developer with a deep interest in creating meaningful digital
              experiences. My journey into web development started with
              curiosity about how websites work, and it has evolved into a
              commitment to building accessible, performant, and beautiful web
              applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that great software is not just about functionalityâ€”it's
              about creating experiences that are intuitive, inclusive, and
              delightful for all users. Whether I'm writing semantic HTML,
              crafting responsive layouts, or implementing complex JavaScript
              functionality, I always keep the end user in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond coding, I enjoy playing acoustic guitar, exploring the
              outdoors through hiking, and watching Chinese animations. I also
              contribute to open-source projects, believing that collaboration
              and knowledge-sharing are essential to growth in the tech
              community.

            Areas Where I'm Building Confidence
          </h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              Growth requires honesty about our current limitations. These are
              areas where I'm actively working to improve my skills and
              knowledge:
            </p>
            <ul class="confidence-list">
              <li>
                <h3>Backend Development & API Design</h3>
                <p>
                  While I'm comfortable consuming APIs, designing and building
                  robust backend systems is something I'm still learning. I want
                  to understand server architecture, database design, and
                  security best practices more deeply.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Advanced Testing Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                  I know the basics of unit testing, but I want to become
                  proficient in integration testing, E2E testing, and
                  test-driven development (TDD) to write more reliable code.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
                <p>
                  Understanding how to profile and optimize application
                  performanceâ€”from reducing bundle sizes to implementing
                  efficient rendering strategiesâ€”is an area I'm actively
                  exploring.
                </p>

              <li>
                <h3>System Design & Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                  Designing scalable systems and making architectural decisions
                  for large applications is challenging for me. I'm learning
                  about design patterns, scalability, and maintainable code
                  architecture.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h3>DevOps & CI/CD</h3>
                <p>
                  Setting up deployment pipelines, managing cloud
                  infrastructure, and understanding containerization with Docker
                  are skills I'm currently developing to become a more
                  well-rounded developer.

            <blockquote>
              <p>Hey there, future Stephen! ðŸ‘‹</p>
              <p>
                If you're reading this, you've come a long way from where you
                started. Remember when you were nervous about joining this
                program? When you wondered if you had what it takes? Look at you
                now!
              </p>
              <p>
                I hope you've pushed through the challenges, celebrated the
                small wins, and learned not just from successes but also from
                mistakes. Remember that every bug you encountered taught you
                something, every project you completed added to your skills, and
                every line of code you wrote made you a better developer.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stay humble. Technology changes rapidly, and there will always
                be more to learn. Keep that curiosity alive. Keep asking
                questions. Keep building things. And most importantly, keep
                helping others on their journeyâ€”you were once where they are
                now.
              </p>
              <p>
                Don't forget why you started: to create meaningful experiences
                that make people's lives better. Keep that purpose at the center
                of everything you build.
              </p>
              <p>You've got this! ðŸ’ª</p>

            Final Thoughts
          </h2>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              This program represents more than just learning to codeâ€”it's about
              transformation. It's about becoming the kind of developer who
              doesn't just write code, but solves problems. Who doesn't just
              build features, but creates experiences. Who doesn't just work
              alone, but collaborates and lifts others up.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm excited about the journey ahead. I know there will be late
              nights debugging, moments of frustration when things don't work,
              and times when I'll question if I'm making progress. But I also
              know there will be breakthrough moments, the satisfaction of
              solving complex problems, and the joy of seeing my projects come
              to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              To anyone reading this who's also on this journey: we're in this
              together. Let's learn, grow, and build amazing things. The best is
              yet to come! ðŸš€
